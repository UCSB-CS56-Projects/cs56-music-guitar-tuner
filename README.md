W14 Ready! (Bronwyn Perry-Huston)
# cs56-music-guitar-tuner

Standard tuner for 6 string guitar, playing the E-A-d-g-b-e strings. 

Original code was here:

* [Archive link](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/cs56/issues/0000763/)
* [Mantis link](https://foo.cs.ucsb.edu/56mantis/view.php?id=763)

Modified in S13 to try to add actual pitch detection functionality.

Code is NOT yet in a working state.   The Complex and FFT functionality does not yet detect pitch.  See description.txt

Suggestion: try the autocorrelation method instead.   See if the code here can be refactored and adapted.
